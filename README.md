# Training for the ACM - ICPC competition @ UniTN

Every year, UniTN sponsors the participation of some teams of students in the regional contest of the ACM-ICPC competition. 
The ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest is the oldest programming competition, running since the seventies.

In order to participate, teams are selected in the following way:

* Universities organise local competitions to select the beast teams to send to the regional contest.

    * @UniTN: We run a series of meetings to train on the ACM-ICPC problems from April to May. At the end of May, a local competition is held to select one (or more) teams.

* The best teams participate in a regional contest; Italy belongs to the SWERC group, whose competitions are normally held in November.
    * @UniTN: The expenses to participate in the event are (almost) fully covered by UniTN. The selected teams perform additional training from September to November.
    
* The best teams in the regional contest participate in the world contest, usually held on the next year.
    * @UniTN: We never got to that pointâ€¦
